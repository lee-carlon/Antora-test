Field service routing optimizes itineraries of employees visiting customers locations over the upcoming period of time.
Visits require the employees to have various skills and to arrive in the specified availability windows.
The goal is to minimize the time employees spend by traveling and waiting, and, by that, increasing the number of scheduled visits.
